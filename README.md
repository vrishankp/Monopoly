# Monopoly

Instructions:
1. Download and run the Python program
2. Enter the number of dice rolls to simulate
3. The screen should now display the number of times the player ends on each tile. Notice that some tiles (like Chance or Go to Jail) have relatively small numbers. This is because it is rare that they stay at the tile at the end.
4. If this is the first time running, data.csv will appear and will populate the first row with the names of all the tiles. The 2nd row should have the results from this run. Subsequent runs will append to the end of the file the new results from those trials
5. At the end of each run, the results of the percentages will be shown as a bar graph
