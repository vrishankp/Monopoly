# Monopoly

Instructions:
1. Download and run the Python program
2. Enter the number of dice rolls to simulate
3. The screen should now display the number of times the player ends on each tile. Notice that some tiles (like Chance or Go to Jail) have relatively small numbers. This is because it is rare that they stay at the tile at the end.
